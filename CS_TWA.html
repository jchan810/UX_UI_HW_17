            <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
            <p>Teach with Africa is a non-profit organization, known primarily for their exchange programs for American and South African educators. Their goal is to provide South African children quality education, as the country is in desperate need of trained educators, and only 5% of Black South African students qualify for a university application.</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The organization’s original website was cluttered, lacked information hierarchy, and made finding important information extremely difficult, if not impossible, for potential users. As a result, the organization was not receiving enough applicants for their exchange programs.

            Founder, Marjorie Schlenoff, wanted a complete website redesign to improve website navigation, visual aesthetics, and increase engagement with Teach with Africa.</p>
        <h2>Contraints</h2>
        <p>While we essentially had free range with our redesign, we were given a couple crucial constrains. When choosing a color palette, we were limited to variations of the South African flag, as it had to match the Teach with Africa logo, and Marjorie requested for the “Gallery” page to remain on the dropdown navigation, rather than being moved to the website footer.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>We aimed to create a site that is easily navigable with images, colors, and other visual design elements that align with Teach with Africa’s core messaging. Creating an enjoyable experience will encourage users to interact with the organization, and provide clear paths for program enrollment and donations. </p>
        <hr class="solid">
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>My group and I caught the organization at the beginning of their own redesign process, and worked directly with founder, Marjorie Schlenoff, to discuss the organization’s mission and what elements of the website were most important to Teach with Africa. 

            We started by defining our user and researching various study abroad and exchange programs that had a similar informational structure to what we were striving towards, which helped us reorganize the hierarchy of the website’s content.</p>

          <p>We quickly moved to low and mid-fidelity prototypes for desktop and mobile in Figma, and iterated them as we received feedback from user tests after every draft.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Mid fidelity prototypes</p>
        <p>Many iterations of the website were reworked as we conducted user tests after every prototype was created. Once the mid-fi wireframes were finalized, we used the Teach with Africa logo as inspiration for the color palette, and focused on creating a style guide that would allow us to create a visually appealing website while presenting information in a clear, easily-digestible way.</p>
